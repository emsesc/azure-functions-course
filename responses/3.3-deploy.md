## Deploying through Azure Static Web Apps

### Concepts to know:

* Web Deployment
* Azure Static Web Apps

Now that we can display emotion data and run our function locally, let's try deploying it onto the web so that everyone can access your website remotely. We'll be doing this through Azure Static Web Apps.

**Web Deployment** is the process of deploying our code (in our case, our HTML, CSS, and JS) from the local computer to a remote hosting platform. When deployed, a website will be able to be accessed by other computers, and not just your own.

**Azure Static Web Apps** is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a GitHub repository. That means we can simply commit our code to GitHub, and Azure will take the code from the repo and deploy it in a custom domain.

Let's get started.

The first step would be to commit your code as a repo in GitHub, but in your case, your code should already be committed. Thus, we'll simply move on to deployment.

**Installing Azure Static Web Apps VSCode Extension**

1. In Visual Studio Code, open your GitHub repo.
2. Select the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left. It should look like four squares, with the top right square separated from everyone else.
3. Search for 'Azure Static Web Apps', and you should see the extension 'Azure Static Web Apps (Preview)'. Install this extension.

**Creating an Azure Static Web App**

1. Now, select the Azure logo in the Activity Bar on the left to open the Azure extensions window. It should look something like:

   Note: Make sure you're signed into Azure and GitHub from Visual Studio Code. You should receive a prompt to sign in if you are not.
2. Hover over the **STATIC WEB APPS (PREVIEW)** label and click the plus sign to create a new one.
   1. Enter a name for your new web app.
   2. Select the master branch.
   3. You will then see *select the location of your application code*. This is searching for the location of the API in your application, but we will not have one in our case. Click the '/', and a 'Skip for now' should appear. Select this. However, if you plan to add an API, read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/add-api).
   4. Now, you should see *Enter the path of your build output relative to your app's location*. This is relevant if you are using certain frontend frameworks, but since we are using vanilla JS, we can simply clear the field and press Enter.
   5. Select a location nearest you and press Enter.
3. Once your app has been created, a confirmation notification will appear in Visual Studio Code that says *Successfully created new static web app...*.
4. Go back to the **STATIC WEB APPS (PREVIEW)** label and expand your subscription name underneath. You should see the name of your app. Right click and select *Open in Portal* to view the app in the Azure portal.
5. The portal should open in a new browser window with your web app displayed. Click the "URL" to see your web app now deployed remotely!

Congratulations, you've just deployed a web app using Azure Static Web Apps!

### The End (AKA your project should work  now ðŸ¤ª)

* Navigate to your custom URL 
* Go through your project as if you were an user trying to use your product.
* *You should see emotion data printed out in the correct location*

   **To officially complete this learning lab, commit your code!**
