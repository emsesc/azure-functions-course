## Parsing Multipart

At this point, you should have created a new HTTP trigger function in your Azure portal. If you have not done this, please do it now. 
In your Azure Portal, go into your HTTP function and into the index.js file. You should see starter code there that has something like `module.exports...`.
This is the file that we will be editing.

<br />

The Azure Function needs to:

1. receive and parse an image from a webpage
2. call the Face API and analyze the image 


<br />


We're going to be focusing on Part 1, which involves parsing multipart form data. In any HTML `<Form>` element that receives involves a file upload (which ours does), the data is encoded in the `multipart/form-data` method. The default http encoding method is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which encodes text into name/value pairs and works for text inputs, but it is inefficient for files or binary inputs. `multipart/form-data` indicates that one or more files are being inputted. Parsing this type of data is a little more complicated than usual. To simplify the process, we're going to use an npm library called `parse-multipart`.  

<br />


To import Node packages, we use the `require`  function:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");
```

This imports the `parse-multipart`  package into our code, and we can now call any function in the package using `multipart.Function()`. 

<br />
<br />

Your function should look like this:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.'); 
};
 
```

<br />

Before we start parsing, go to the [parse-multipart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart) documentation for some context on what the package does.  Look specifically at the example in the **Usage** section and what they are doing, as we're going to do something similar.

<br />

Notice that `multipart.Parse(body, boundary)`  requires two parameters.  I've already gotten the boundary for youâ€“ just like the documentation example, our boundary is a string in the format `"----WebKitFormBoundary(random characters here)"`. 

<br />

In the `multipart.Parse()` call, you need to figure out what the body parameter should be.

Hint: It should be the request body. Think about the example Azure function. How did we access that?

```js

//here's your boundary:
var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
  
// TODO: assign the body variable the correct value
var body = '<WHAT GOES HERE?>'

// parse the body
var parts = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
```
